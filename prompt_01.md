build a simple polymarket clone MVP - a predictive market where users can create makrets  (yes/no questions) buy shares on outcomes and see live odds.  tech stack: next.js 14 (app router) for frontend + API routes, mariadb for database (will connect via database_url env var).  THis will be deployed on a vps using dokply.  so ensure the project works with nixpacks (specificaly node 20+ in packlage.json enginers).  start by createing the project structure, a detailed readmea and a clear database schema (markets, best, users tables)  Dont implement yet, just architecture and docs.
